# Haskell algoritms

This repository is a collection of algorithms implemented in haskell. I'm implementing them as an exercise for learning
haskell, so don't expect pristine quality or the most efficient implementations.

If you have any doubts or suggestions leave an issue or a pull request.

Enjoy!
